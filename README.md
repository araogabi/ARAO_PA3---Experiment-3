## **EXPERIMENT 3: PYTHON DATA ANALYSIS (PANDAS)**

## Background of the Experiment

Pandas is a powerful Python library designed for data analysis and manipulation. It provides two main data structures: Series and DataFrame. A Series is like a one-dimensional array that can hold different types of data (such as integers or strings) and has labels for each element. A DataFrame, on the other hand, is a two-dimensional table where you can store and work with data in rows and columns. Pandas makes it easy to clean, filter, and analyze data, and it integrates well with other data science tools in Python.

## Objectives of the Experiment

1. To identify the codes and functions incorporated in the Pandas library
2. To be able to apply and use the different codes and functions in creating a Python program using a Pandas library

_Attached herewith is the Jupyter Notebook file where you can see the code for each problems._

## Problems

For this programming assignment, download the attached “**Cars**” file and save it to your default user folder.

### **PROBLEM 1**

Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P1.py

Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations:
a. Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas
b. Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.

### **PROBLEM 2**
Save your file as Surname_Pandas-P2.py

Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.
a. Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7…) of cars.
b. Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’.
c. How many cylinders (‘cyl’) does the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have?
d. Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have

## Getting Started

### Tools Used
1. Anaconda Navigator
2. Jupyter Notebook

### Executing the Program
1. **Import Pandas** - Importing `Pandas` is essential in Python for efficient data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis through its powerful data structures and functions. Without accessing `Pandas`, the code for these problems wouldn't run, as it is dependent on this library.
```
import pandas as pd
```
2. **`Shift + Enter`** - To run the code, press `Shift + Enter` while the cell is selected, or click the `Run` button in the notebook toolbar. You will see the output below the cell.
